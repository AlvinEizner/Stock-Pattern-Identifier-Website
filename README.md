# Stock-Pattern-Identifier-Website
Enter the ticker/symbol of a stock, and be notified of the dates (if any) where common trading patterns occur. Once a valid ticker is entered, a live chart containing stock candles and prices over the past month will be displayed. Current patterns include Three White Soldiers, Three Black Crows, Bullish Engulfing Candles, Bearish Engulfing Candles, and Shooting Stars. The live site also provides informative pop-ups that describe these patterns in extra depth.  The project was coded in Python, and the main libraries used include finnhub, flask, matplotlib/mplfinance, and pandas.
